This repository contains implementations of popular ML-algorithms from scratch using Python and their theoretical description. In addition, the course will feature tutorials on the necessary ML-libraries and all the theory of concepts in ML, starting from methods of evaluating models and ending with optimization methods.

At the moment, the course is under development and new notebooks will be gradually added.
